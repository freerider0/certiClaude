# Test Setup Summary for CertiFast

## What We've Accomplished

We've successfully set up a comprehensive testing framework for the CertiFast application, specifically focusing on the create-agency endpoint.

### 1. Testing Dependencies Installed
- **Jest**: Test runner and assertion library
- **@testing-library/react**: React component testing utilities
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: Custom matchers for DOM elements
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: API mocking for integration tests
- **ts-jest**: TypeScript support for Jest

### 2. Configuration Files Created
- **jest.config.js**: Main Jest configuration with Next.js support
- **jest.setup.js**: Global test setup including environment variables and mocks

### 3. Test Structure
- Created test utilities directory at `/src/test-utils/`
- Mock implementations for Supabase and Stripe
- Reusable test data in `test-data.ts`
- Comprehensive README with testing guidelines

### 4. Create-Agency Endpoint Tests
Successfully created and tested 6 comprehensive test cases:

#### ✅ Authentication Tests (2 tests)
- Unauthorized requests (401)
- User ID mismatch scenarios (403)

#### ✅ Validation Tests (1 test)
- Missing required fields (400)

#### ✅ Success Cases (1 test)
- Successful agency creation with Stripe customer
- Proper database relationships established

#### ✅ Error Handling (2 tests)
- Stripe API failures with graceful handling
- Database transaction failures with proper cleanup

### 5. Test Scripts Added to package.json
```json
"test": "jest",
"test:watch": "jest --watch",
"test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
"test:ci": "jest --ci --coverage --maxWorkers=2"
```

## Running the Tests

### Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

### Run specific test file:
```bash
npm test -- src/app/api/onboarding/create-agency/route.test.ts
```

### Run tests in watch mode:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Run tests with coverage report:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Next Steps

To extend the test coverage to other parts of the application:

1. **API Routes**: Follow the same pattern for other API endpoints
2. **React Components**: Use @testing-library/react for component tests
3. **Integration Tests**: Use MSW for more complex API interaction tests
4. **E2E Tests**: Consider adding Playwright or Cypress for end-to-end tests

## Key Learnings

1. **Mock Early**: Jest mocks must be defined before importing the modules that use them
2. **Next.js Specifics**: NextResponse needs special mocking for API route tests
3. **Test Environment**: Use `@jest-environment node` for API route tests
4. **Cleanup**: Always test error scenarios include proper cleanup operations

The test setup is now ready for expansion to cover more of the application!
