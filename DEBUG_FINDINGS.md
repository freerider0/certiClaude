# Agency Sidebar Navigation Debug Findings

## Issue Description
User reports that only "Dashboard" and "Settings" items are showing in the agency sidebar. Missing items include: Properties, Orders, Customers, Earnings, Reports, and Pricing.

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Navigation Configuration Check
- **File**: `/src/config/navigation/agency-nav.ts`
- **Status**: âœ… All navigation items are properly defined in the configuration
- **Items Found**: Dashboard, Properties, Orders, Customers, Earnings (with children), Reports (with children), Pricing, Settings (with children)

### 2. Component Structure
- **Agency Layout**: `/src/app/[locale]/agency/layout.tsx` - Correctly imports and passes `agencyNavItems` to `DashboardLayout`
- **DashboardLayout**: `/src/components/layout/dashboard-layout.tsx` - Correctly passes items to `SidebarNav`
- **SidebarNav**: `/src/components/layout/sidebar/sidebar-nav.tsx` - Maps through items and renders `SidebarItem` for each
- **SidebarItem**: `/src/components/layout/sidebar/sidebar-item.tsx` - Renders individual navigation items

### 3. Added Debug Features
1. Console logging in `SidebarNav` to track received items
2. Console logging in `SidebarItem` to track individual item rendering
3. Safety checks for invalid data structures
4. Pathname normalization for locale handling
5. Created test pages at:
   - `/[locale]/agency/test-nav` - Shows raw navigation data
   - `/[locale]/agency/debug-sidebar` - Compares different rendering approaches

### 4. Potential Issues to Check

1. **Console Errors**: Check browser console for any JavaScript errors when loading the agency pages
2. **Icon Mapping**: Some icons might be missing from the icon mapping, causing items to fail rendering
3. **CSS/Styling**: Items might be rendered but hidden due to CSS issues
4. **Locale/Routing**: The pathname matching might be affected by locale prefixes

## Next Steps

1. **Visit the debug pages**:
   - Go to `/en/agency/test-nav` to see if all navigation items are in the data
   - Go to `/en/agency/debug-sidebar` to see different rendering approaches

2. **Check browser console** for any errors or the debug logs that were added

3. **Verify icon mapping** - Check if all icons used in agency-nav.ts exist in icon-mapping.ts

4. **Inspect DOM** - Use browser DevTools to see if items are rendered but hidden

## Files Modified for Debugging
- `/src/components/layout/sidebar/sidebar-nav.tsx` - Added debug logging and safety checks
- `/src/components/layout/sidebar/sidebar-item.tsx` - Added debug logging and validation
- `/src/app/[locale]/agency/layout.tsx` - Added debug logging

## Files Created for Testing
- `/src/app/[locale]/agency/test-nav/page.tsx` - Test page showing raw navigation data
- `/src/app/[locale]/agency/debug-sidebar/page.tsx` - Debug page with multiple rendering approaches
- `/src/components/layout/sidebar/sidebar-nav-debug.tsx` - Simplified debug component

After checking these debug pages and console logs, we should be able to identify the exact cause of the missing navigation items.
